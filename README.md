# ASEfinal

Project of ASE (Architecture of Operating Systems).

The subject is a simulation of a restaurant trying to abide by (french) covid rules.
Police verification is done via a thread where I make sure that there isn't any race condition with POSIX semaphores.
Testing was also rated but left entirely up to me.

More on the subject in the 'TP5.pdf' file (redacted in french)
